You can now sign up for a 3 day free trial of the ShelfScan browser extension.  After installing, click on the ShelfScan sync
button on the bottom right corner and then on the free trial button.

## Extension in Public Beta

The ShelfScan extension for Firefox has been approved and I'm now offering a free trial, so I've decided to put it into public beta.  I am also opening testing for the Safari extension via TestFlight.

## Collection Status

Games in the list below the scanner now show a checkmark in the upper left when they are in your collection.  If the game is not in your collection, it will show a barcode icon.

## Thumbnails in Select Lists

When scanning a game that hasn't been verified, the lists for game and version now contain thumbnails.

Click on the down arrow in the add button, and you'll find two new modes - add for trade and add to wishlist.

## About Page

I've added an [about page](https://shelfscan.io/about) to ShelfScan.io.  Nuff' said.

## Image Cache Management

Did you know that ShelfScan caches all of the BGG images it downloads on your device?  If you want to reclaim the space or feel the need to refresh things, you can now go to Settings > Image Cache and clear the image cache.

I think that's enough for a little while!  Whew!
